<h2>Overall Assessment</h2>

Based on the analysis, the company's financial performance has shown substantial improvement in the last 4 quarters.  However, a significant decrease in promoter holding is a negative indicator and requires further investigation. The increasing shareholding of FIIs and DIIs is a positive sign.  A comprehensive analysis considering all factors is needed for a final rating.
