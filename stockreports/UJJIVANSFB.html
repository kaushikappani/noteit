<h1>Ujjivan Small Finance Bank Ltd Stock Analysis</h1>

<h2>Overall Assessment:</h2>
<p>Based on the limited data provided, a comprehensive assessment is challenging.  The available data shows mixed trends. While some parameters like the number of shareholders have significantly increased, the shareholding pattern of promoters has decreased, which warrants further investigation.  More detailed financial data (specifically the numerical values in the quarterly and yearly results) is needed for a conclusive rating.</p>


<h2>Shareholding Pattern Analysis:</h2>
<p>The number of shareholders has significantly increased over the past year, indicating growing investor interest.  However, the promoter's holding has decreased, which is a negative sign.  FIIs and DIIs show fluctuating participation.</p>
