<p><strong>Analysis:</strong>  While promoter holding has slightly decreased in the last quarter, there has been a consistent increase in FII and DII holdings over the past 3-4 quarters. This indicates increasing confidence in the company from institutional investors. The decrease in public shareholding could be attributed to institutional buying. Overall, this is a positive sign for the company's future prospects.</p>
